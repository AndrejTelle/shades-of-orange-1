I have it start up automatically after login, so when I need it it instantly returns all results it finds on disk. And with instantly I really mean INSTANTLY. Ever since I’ve started using Everything, I worry much less about where I put stuff on my disk because I can find it in a second. It's great during development as well because it will find e.g. all copies of a certain DLL on my system which I might want to delete from everywhere so that none of the copies can mess with my applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday this screen popped up – really the first or maybe the second time in over a year – and it was just to hilarious to pass by!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
