  <content>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you want a girlfriend, avoid working in the computer games industry like the plague. If you work seven days a week, 15 hours a day for almost two years, with barely enough time for a pint, you have no time whatsoever for relationships. Plus computer-games makers are regarded as being about as hip and cool as abattoir workers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toby Gard, creator of Lara Croft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;"As we said in the preface to the first edition, C "wears well as one's experience with it grows." With a decade more experience, we still feel that way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie &lt;/p&gt;</content>
